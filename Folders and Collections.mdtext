Title:  Folders and Collections

Seq:    1.4

Level:  2 - Section

Body:

Unlike some systems, Notenik does not expect or require you to keep all of your notes in a singular location, sometimes referred to as a *vault*. 

With Notenik, a folder full of Notes is referred to as a *Collection*, and you can have as many of these as you like, and store them wherever you would like.
