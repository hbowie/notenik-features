Body:

Notenik offers both a simple search and an advanced search, which allows you to select which fields should be included in the search. 

In both cases -- simple and advanced -- one Note is shown at a time, allowing you to advance to the next matching Note whenever you are ready. Occurrences of the search term or phrase are highlighted in each note's display. 

Notenik does not offer complex queries.
