Title:  Integration via AppleScript

Seq:    1.19

Level:  2 - Section

Body:

Although Notenik is not scriptable via AppleScript in the classic sense, it does implement a number of custom AppleScript commands designed to support integration with other apps -- most notably, [Hook][]. The Hook team is currently developing and testing integration scripts that will allow Notenik to be used with their Mac app.
